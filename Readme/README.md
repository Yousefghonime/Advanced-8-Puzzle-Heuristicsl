# Intelligent 8-Puzzle Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic 8-Puzzle game solver using Artificial Intelligence search strategies.

## Features
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Guarantees the shortest path in terms of moves.
- **A* Search**: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic for optimized performance.
- **Modular Design**: Separated logic from execution for better readability.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python main.py` to see the solver in action.
